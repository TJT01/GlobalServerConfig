# Global Server Config

A simple mod that makes the Forge config system load configs from the global `config` folder in the game directory (where client and common configs are) instead of the world's `serverconfig` folder.  
This means that **all of your worlds will share the same config files**.

*Note: You need to load a world for server configs to show up*
